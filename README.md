```lrc
[00:16.52] Champagne flutes and
[00:18.51] Dinner suits that
[00:20.54] Keep your focus
[00:22.26] Away from the cheating hands
[00:23.62] Tell me
[00:24.72] Does that sexy
[00:26.53] Gown say what she's
[00:28.61] Got in store for her man?
[00:41.11] 
[00:31.47] So we roll the dice,
[00:34.02] See where they may fall
[00:38.04] Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
[00:42.03] See whom it may call
[00:45.78] Give into temptation
[00:51.25] Win it
[00:53.39] Maybe lose it all
[00:58.34] Who knows
[00:59.09] Where the whims of fate may lead us
[01:16.59] 
[01:35.27] Chandeliers and
[01:37.18] Decolletes that
[01:39.18] Keep your focus
[01:40.60] Away from the cheating eyes
[01:42.23] Tell me
[01:43.17] What's that bow tie
[01:45.16] On the card guy
[01:46.76] Tell you 'bout his design
[01:59.26] 
[01:49.61] So we roll the dice,
[01:52.34] See where they may fall
[01:56.02] Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
[02:00.17] See whom it may call
[02:04.01] Give into another vice,
[02:08.16] See where it might lead
[02:12.38] Come on, let's just enjoy the spice
[02:16.03] Life and feel so free
[02:20.09] Give into temptation
